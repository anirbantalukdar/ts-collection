# ts-collection

This is re-write of the java collection classes in typescript.
There is some tweak as typescript templates are not as equivalent as Java.

# license.

I dont know much about license terms. Please let me know (talukdar.anirban@gmail.com) 
if you have any issues with the license. I thought MIT is a good choice.

# usability

I am writing the mocha based unit test cases one by one. so for the classes whose test
cases are already written I believe this is safe to use. For rest I am adding support 
one by one.

# npmjs.

the library is published in npmjs with url 'ts-collection'

# API documentation

For API documentation please refer to Javadoc API documentation 1.8
due to. There is some tweak for map interface becuase of method override 
limitation in typescript. for index based operation I have appended 'At" 
like set, setAt to differentiate these as seperate methods.

# examples.
please refer to test cases of the GitHub project git@github.com:anirbantalukdar/ts-collection-test.git

# ts-collection

This is re-write of the java collection classes in typescript.
There is some tweak as typescript templates are not as equivalent as Java.

# license.

I dont know much about license terms. Please let me know (talukdar.anirban@gmail.com) 
if you have any issues with the license. I thought MIT is a good choice.

# usability

I am writing the mocha based unit test cases one by one. so for the classes whose test
cases are already written I believe this is safe to use. For rest I am adding support 
one by one.

# npmjs.

the library is published in npmjs with url 'ts-collection'
